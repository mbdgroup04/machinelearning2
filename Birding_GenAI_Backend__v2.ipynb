Their diet primarily consists of small fish, which they hunt by diving from a perch. They also eat aquatic insects, crustaceans, and tadpoles.  A fun fact about the Common Kingfisher is that their vibrant blue and orange plumage isn't due to pigments but to the structure of their feathers which refracts light, creating an iridescent effect called \"structural coloration.\"\n",
